   - Download the file: `accepted_2007_to_2018Q4.csv`
   - Place it in this directory (`data/`)

2. **Alternative Sources:**
   - LendingClub official statistics (historical data)
   - Other public loan datasets with similar structure

### Dataset Information

- **Name**: LendingClub Accepted Loans (2007-2018 Q4)
- **Size**: ~2.2M records, ~150 features
- **Format**: CSV
- **Target**: Loan status (binary: paid vs defaulted)

### Expected File Structure

```
data/
├── accepted_2007_to_2018Q4.csv    # Raw data (place here after download)
├── processed.csv                   # Generated by preprocessing
└── README.md                       # This file
```

### Data Privacy

- Public domain / Open data

### File Size Note

The raw CSV file is approximately **1-2 GB**. It is not included in the repository due to size constraints. You must download it separately.

## Generated Files

After running the notebooks or scripts, these files will be created:

- `processed.csv` - Cleaned and feature-engineered data
- `shap_analysis.csv` - SHAP values for explainability analysis

These are also not tracked by git (see .gitignore).
